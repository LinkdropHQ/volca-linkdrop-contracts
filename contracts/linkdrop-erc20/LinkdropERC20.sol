/**
 * @title Linkdrop ERC20 Contract
 * @dev Contract sends tokens from linkdropper's account to receiver on claim.
 * 
 * When deploying contract, linkdropper provides linkdrop parameters: 
 * (token address, amount of tokens to be linkdropped, linkdrop verification address).
 * 
 * Linkdrop verification address is used to verify that links are signed by LINKDROPPER. 
 * 
 * Linkdropper generates claim links. Each link contains an ephemeral private key 
 * signed by the private key corresponding to linkdrop verification address. 
 * The ephemeral private key assigned to link can only! be used once to sign receiver's address
 * Receiver claims tokens by providing signature to the Relayer Server, 
 * which then calls smart contract to claim tokens
 * 
 * On claim smart contract verifies, that receiver provided address signed 
 * with ephemeral private key assigned to the link. 
 * If everything is correct, smart contract sends tokens to receiver.
